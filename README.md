## üìùDeployed Demo:
<a href="https://hubazar.vercel.app/">Hubazar on Vercel</a>

## üìùDescription:

As a team work we created a marketplace using Javascript from scratch to build the App. To achieve this we work shoulder to shoulder in a group of 6 people applying Scrum as an agile methodology and practicing the GIT workflow thoroughly. In the team I worked as Frotend Developer and strengthened my knowledge developing components in Javascript, applying pure CSS styles, working with Node packages, deploying the App, among others.

#### Used technologies:
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] React
- [ ] Redux
- [ ] CSS modules
- [ ] NodeJS
- [ ] ExpressJS
- [ ] Sequelize - PostgreSQL
- [ ] Heroku - Vercel

#### Running the App:

It has two folders: api and client. In these folders will be the back-end code and the front-end respectively. (In both urge NPM INSTALL).

To upload to your database In api you are going to have to create a file called: . env that has the following form:

```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=userPostgres
DB_PASSWORD=passwordPostgres
DB_DATABASE=pf
MERCADOPAGOACCESSTOKEN=tokenMercadopago
MERCAGOPAGOPUBLICKEY=publicKeyMercadopago
```

Using PGAdmin you will create your new "development" database.
You need to replace `userPostgres` and `passwordPostgres` with your own credentials to connect to postgres. Also, you need a Mercadopago credentials to replace `tokenMercadopago` and `publicKeyMercadopago`. This file will be ignored by github as it contains sensitive information (credentials).

#### Features:

#### Unauthenticated users

An anonymous Visitor should be able to browse your e-commerce, view and search for products.

###### As a Guest I want...
